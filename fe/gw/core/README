GW - Goo Web
============

GW is a layer above DOM that allows you to create a more complicated
components out of more than one DOM element, and easily compose these components
directly via DOM (the component hierarchy is derived = require('DOM hierarchy, and
is not tracked separately) and extend these components via a powerful class
system that supports deriving subclasses and overriding class methods at class
level and during instantiation.

Some features:

- does not have any external dependencies
- implements highly extensible class system
  - easy to create classes and singletons
  - reliable support for monkey patching
  - methods can be extended hassle free (both class and instance methods)
  - async methods that return promises can be extended easily too (by
    chaining promises)
- implements component system that supports component nesting/composition
  - components are written using the class system
  - write your own web components
  - create runtime hierarchy of components
  - traverse the component tree
  - no need to track component relationships manually, relationships
    are derived automatically = require('DOM hierarchy
- communication
  - use events for communication between components
  - all events bubble, so it's easy and cheap to listen to any child components
- small core
